# Lore Roadmap

This document details some general things on how lore development is done, who's doing what, etc.
Feel free to modify this as you see fit if you are a lore maintainer.

**This is mostly meant to track who's doing what / keep general notes on if something was touched prior.**

### What belongs here:
- Rough, one line or few-line outlines
- Who to ask for what
- Links to other drafts, wiki pages for finished pieces, etc.

### What does *not* belong here:
- Full draft outlines - **make a new document**, don't bloat this.
- Personal comments/discussions - **do not bloat this**, use the Discord for discussion.

### The Lore Team

- **Head Maintainer**: SpessInquisitor (@Sentre#3048)
- **Maintainer**: Trashnepta (@ursacolonel#3939)
- **Maintainer**: Zandario (@Zandario#0001)
- **Maintainer**: Lord Papalus (@Lord_Papalus#8971)
- **Maintainer**: Merne23 (@Merne23#3986)
- **Maintainer**: Captain277 (@Ariel, Princess of the Gingers#3409)
- **Maintainer**: Shirumic (@Shirumic#3980)

These are the official lore maintainers. If you're just contributing, you aren't forgotten, we just can't list every single person who's ever touched lore here.

### Discord Channels

**#lore-discussion**: Used for general chatter. Create a thread for outline storage, ping people as necessary to add them.
**#lore-submissions**: Used to store threads for lore submissions. This is *not* for outlines, this should be completed drafts to be submitted before they're added to the wiki.
**#character-critique**: Use this if you want opinions on your character, hopefully from people maintaining the species. Be sure to ping.
**#lore-private**: Lore maintainers, server staff, code maintainers have access to this. It's mostly used for staging of changes.

### Hierarchy / Submissions

Citadel RP's lore is more or less treated as open source. Submissions should be put in the Discord channels as necessary. Lore maintainers are expected to triage threads and keep up as things, but, we all know how hard coordinating open source efforts is!

General best practice:
- If you're pushing for something already with someone working on it, ping them to ascertain status first. If there's an issue, ping lore maints.
- If you're pushing for something with drastic effects on conflict in the world, it's a good idea to clear it first.
- If you plan on adding a new species, clear it with lore *and* code maintainers.
- Consider the long term consequences of whatever you're writing. More drastic ideas tend to be more scrutinized to maintain long-term stability.
